Following my dev bootcamp I’ve been keeping up my momentum, working on new projects and reviewing skills, while also serving as a teaching assistant for another cohort. I know the road to that first dev job is rough but I still had the wind taken out of my sails a little following a practice interview and some blunt feedback.

Altogether I am appreciative of the hard criticism I received. The real gut check came because I thought it had gone pretty well, and I was feeling confident in my code skills. I was taken down a notch, but if that kick comes with lots of feedback and recommended resources, it’s a solid net gain.

More than anything, I had to recognize the practice I'm lacking. There are so many things to get caught up in post-bootcamp. Advice flying in from peers and mentors, opinions and incomplete Medium articles from the dread Internet. Ultimately prioritization becomes an acrobatic, fickle thing. My lesson this week was that if an activity doesn’t involve writing lots of code . . . . well it might not be the best use of time.

So even with a few years of self study under my belt, a decent body of finished work, and innumerable dabbling's and experiments, the breadth of all that past effort isn’t as critical as consistently drilling those skills. Daily fingers on keys writing HTML tags, CSS styles, React components, JavaScript function . . . all those little scales and licks of the language that lead to proficiency. That’s the real juice.

Following my interview experience my new resolution was pretty clear: write a small app every day. Doesn’t need to be big or fancy or solve an interesting problem. It just needs to get my hands moving over the familiar elements of Front End Development. React is my go-to, but even within that I am keeping tabs on my HTML and CSS, using denser chunks of JavaScript and looking over lots of new libraries. But in terms of practice, simplicity and consistency is a reliable provider of proficiency. Of course, making resolutions is an easy habit, and it all comes back to daily discipline.

So apply this to yourself. Stop thinking, fire up `creat-react-app` (or whatever your instrument of choice is), and just start coding. It can be a weather app, a to do list, or something you’ve already built in another framework. It doesn’t matter at all. Neither does finishing the project completely! Trust me, if you find the momentum to take a project all the way, you’ll take it all the way. But if the app fizzles and the work starts feeling pointless, then chalk up your progress and your lessons from that experiment, and move on. You did the most important thing by getting your fingers on the keys. Do it today, do it tomorrow, and don’t worry about it until you look back someday and are surprised by your output.
